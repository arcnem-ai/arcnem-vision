  tagline: Upload a photo, and a swarm of AI agents — orchestrated by LangGraph, connected through MCP, and configured from a database — will generate embeddings, write descriptions, and make everything searchable by meaning.

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Database-driven agent graphs" icon="setting">
    Define AI workflows as rows, not code. Swap processing pipelines per organization without redeploying anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GenUI chat interface" icon="puzzle">
    The AI generates real Flutter widgets at runtime — cards, galleries, interactive components — composed from JSON.
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-device Gemma" icon="laptop">
    Intent parsing happens locally on the phone before anything hits the network. Private by default.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLIP vector search" icon="magnifier">
    Images and descriptions embedded in the same 768-dimensional space. Search by image, by text, or by vibes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visual workflow builder" icon="pencil">
    A React dashboard where you drag-and-drop agent graphs: workers, tools, supervisors, edges, the whole thing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP tools as a first-class primitive" icon="open-book">
    Five registered tools following the open Model Context Protocol standard. Agents call them. You can too.
  </Card>
